# CAN or not CAN

![](./images/logo_100.png)

It is important to note here that nothing in the framework code suggest CAN. Many think **VSVP == CAN** because many of the initial samples are CAN based. But the code is general. It will work for wireless and other transport mechanisms as well. 

**REMEMBER THAT!** and let your mind free.
