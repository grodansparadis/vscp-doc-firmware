# Introduction Level II

The VSCP Level II standard is made to be used in more capable devices. It is made to be used in devices that can handle a full TCP/IP stack and have enough memory to handle more advanced tasks. A Level II device should also be able to handle more complex decision matrix rules and be able to store more events in the event queue.
